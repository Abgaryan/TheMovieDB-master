# TheMovieDB


 

The internet movie database is a web page similar to IMDB where you can find a list of movies with their description, images, trailers and so on. It has quite interesting api to request data.

The app  fetches the data from the API that they provides to see the latest movies, and when the user clicks on any item, see the basic details of the movie.
 
As special feature, the app will have a button in the main screen to filter the movies by date.
 
Optionally an infinite scroll will be useful to browse more movies.
